            The purpose of *Personal Network Yoga Discipline* is to help you earn more wealth of all 9 different kinds.
        </p>

        <p>
            To fulfill the purpose stated above, we are building the most unique app of the post-COVID world. Amongst other things, we are using lessons learned from the year 2020, that could not have been learned any other way, had we not lived through this incredible
            period of history.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was after all the first instance of a global pandemic that happened in the digital internet era. An era when an insanely mind bogling number of people and things are connected to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            What you are reading now are some of our early thoughts on how the *Personal Network Yoga Discipline* app should work and how it should not.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are parallely building, experimenting, and refining this discipline app at the same time, and invite you to participate in the process of its creation (( TODO link )),
        </p>
        <p>
            In the knowledge body of Hindu Dharma, wealth has been articulated rather interestingly. It has been classified into 8 different kinds, and it is argued that each of these kinds of wealth is equal to the other.
        </p>

        <p>
            We respectfully disagree, but we also appreciate this rather interesting outlook on wealth.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a team of artsy entrepreneurs, we are committed to learning from wisdom all around our planet, but our primary focus is to build real solutions of our times, for real problems of our times.
        </p>

        <p>
            So we have borrowed from that knowledge, of different kinds of wealth, and have both modified it and added to it. Allow us to share with you how we now classify wealth to be of 9 different kinds, and how we think you shouldn't treat them equally, but
            instead assign different priorities to them, that you should change based on time and context and your current phase in life.
        </p>

        <p>
            With all that background, here are the 9 different kinds of wealth that *Personal Network Yoga Discipline* will help you earn more of.
        </p>

        <p>
            (( TODO use fun cartoon images, to list here the new 9 different types of wealth that will be earned ))
        </p>

        <p>
            You will also finish more work — and feel genuinely more peaceful happy accomplished and sexy.
        </p>

        <p>
            This discipline will also help you defeat your enemies, and destroy their ill intents.
        </p>

        <p>
            And it will help you build better friendships and deeper relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can look at any number of [[ these 10,000 specific examples ]] to see how the personal network yoga discipline works. Of course, the best way to see how this discipline works is to start using it yourself, and evalutate it's impact in your own life.
        </p>

        <p>
            If this discipline does not fulfill it's stated purpose for you, or even if it does, we are comitted to giving you a full refund at any time you request.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other than a full refund policy, this discipline app is also committed to never sending you any notification ever! Yes, no notifications ever!! You will use this app without being constantly obsessively reminded of it. Or you won't use it, which is fine.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a yoga discipline app, not a social media dopamine drug factory that is unsatiably greedy and hungry for your attention.
        </p>

        <p>
            This app will always remain entirely standalone, private, and personal. There is no following or follower feature on this app, and will never be.
        </p>

        <p>
            In fact, you will benefit more from the personal network yoga discipline app if you do not even tell nobody that you use it. Also, there will never be any data permissions that this app will need, like access to your photos, or contacts, etcetera.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our ideal customer places more value on their genuine personal growth, as stated in the purpose & promise section above, and places less value on their public image, as stated in the problem section below.
